# Powerline Multiline Theme (Blue)

A clone of the Powerline Multiline Theme with a few tweaks.

**IMPORTANT:** This theme requires that [a font with the Powerline symbols](https://github.com/powerline/fonts) needs to be used in your terminal emulator, otherwise the prompt won't be displayed correctly, i.e. some of the additional icons and characters will be missing. Please follow your operating system's instructions to install one of the fonts from the above link and select it in your terminal emulator.

Please see the original Powerline Multiline Theme for more information.
