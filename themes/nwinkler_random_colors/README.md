# Nwinkler Random Color Theme

## Description

The *Nwinkler Random Color* Theme is based on the [nwinkler theme](https://github.com/Bash-it/bash-it/wiki/Themes#nwinkler), but it randomizes the colors for:

* time
* username
* hostname
* path

The random colors are chosen the first time this theme is used and saved to the `~/.nwinkler_random_colors` file. So, the next time you connect to the same machine, you will get the same colors.

To force new random colors to be selected, run the command:

```sh
randomize_nwinkler
```

## Usage Scenario

This theme is especially useful when connecting to many different machines and switching between them often. Yes, the hostname *is* present in the prompt. But I argue that it's a lot faster to get a "feel" of what machine you are currently on because of the custom colors on that machine's prompt than by reading the hostname.
