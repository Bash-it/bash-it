**Bash-it** is a collection of community Bash commands and scripts for Bash 3.2+.
(And a shameless ripoff of [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) :smiley:)

Includes autocompletion, themes, aliases, custom functions, a few stolen pieces from Steve Losh, and more.

Bash-it provides a solid framework for using, developing and maintaining shell scripts and custom commands for your daily work.
If you're using the _Bourne Again Shell_ (Bash) regularly and have been looking for an easy way on how to keep all of these nice little scripts and aliases under control, then Bash-it is for you!
Stop polluting your `~/bin` directory and your `.bashrc` file, fork/clone Bash-it and start hacking away.
