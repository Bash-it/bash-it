Bira Theme
==========

This is a port of Oh My Zsh's `'Bira' <https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/blob/master/themes/bira.zsh-theme>`_ theme. It looks the same as the original, except for the following changes:


* Exit code of last command is not shown
* More informative git prompt (if you want to keep it minimal, please read: :ref:`git_prompt`)
* Position and colour of virtualenv prompt
* No ruby version prompt
