Uninstalling
------------

To uninstall Bash-it, run the ``uninstall.sh`` script found in the ``$BASH_IT`` directory:

.. code-block::

   cd $BASH_IT
   ./uninstall.sh

This will restore your previous Bash profile.
After the uninstall script finishes, remove the Bash-it directory from your machine (\ ``rm -rf $BASH_IT``\ ) and start a new shell.
