Bash-it doctor
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you encounter problems with any part of Bash-it, run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   bash-it doctor

This will reload your bash profile and print out logs of various parts in Bash-it.
Note that this command at default will print all logs, including debug logs.
You can call it like this:

.. code-block:: bash

   bash-it doctor [errors/warnings/all]

In order to get wanted verbosity.
