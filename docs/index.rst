Welcome to Bash-it's documentation!
===================================

**Bash-it** is a collection of community Bash commands and scripts for Bash 3.2+.
(And a shameless ripoff of `oh-my-zsh <https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh>`_)

Includes autocompletion, themes, aliases, custom functions, a few stolen pieces from Steve Losh, and more.

Bash-it provides a solid framework for using, developing and maintaining shell scripts and custom commands for your daily work.
If you're using the *Bourne Again Shell* (Bash) regularly and have been looking for an easy way on how to keep all of these nice little scripts and aliases under control, then Bash-it is for you!  
Stop polluting your ``~/bin`` directory and your ``.bashrc`` file, fork/clone Bash-it and start hacking away.

--------

We think everyone has their own custom scripts accumulated over time.
And so, following in the footsteps of oh-my-zsh, Bash-it is a framework for easily customizing your Bash shell.
Everyone's got a custom toolbox, so let's start making them even better, **as a community!**

Send us a pull request and we'll merge it as long as it looks good.
If you change an existing command, please give an explanation why.
That will help a lot when we merge your changes in.

Please take a look at the :ref:`Contribution Guidelines <contributing>` before reporting a bug or providing a new feature.

Thanks, and happing bashing!
