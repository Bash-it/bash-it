Themes
------

There are over 50+ Bash-it themes to pick from in ``$BASH_IT/themes``.
The default theme is ``bobby``.
Set ``BASH_IT_THEME`` to the theme name you want, or if you've developed your own custom theme outside of ``$BASH_IT/themes``\ ,
point the ``BASH_IT_THEME`` variable directly to the theme file.
To disable theming completely, leave the variable empty.

Examples:

.. code-block:: bash

   # Use the "powerline-multiline" theme
   export BASH_IT_THEME="powerline-multiline"

   # Use a theme outside of the Bash-it folder
   export BASH_IT_THEME="/home/foo/my_theme/my_theme.theme.bash"

   # Disable theming
   export BASH_IT_THEME=""

You can easily preview the themes in your own shell using ``BASH_PREVIEW=true bash-it reload``.

If you've created your own custom prompts, we'd love it if you shared them with everyone else! Just submit a Pull Request.
You can see theme screenshots on `wiki/Themes <https://github.com/Bash-it/bash-it/wiki/Themes>`_.

**NOTE**\ : Bash-it and some themes use UTF-8 characters, so to avoid strange behavior in your terminal, set your locale to ``LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8`` or the equivalent to your language if it isn't American English.
