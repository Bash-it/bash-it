# Bash it

**Bash it** is a mash up of my own bash commands and scripts, other bash stuff I have found.

(And a shameless ripoff of [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh). :)

Includes autocompletion, themes, aliases, custom functions, a few stolen pieces from Steve Losh, and more.

## Install

1. Check a clone of this repo: `git clone https://github.com/revans/bash-it.git ~/.bash_it`
2. Run `~/.bash_it/install.sh` (it automatically backs up your `~/.bash_profile`)
3. Edit your `~/.bash_profile` file in order to customize bash-it.

**NOTE:**
The install script will also prompt you asking if you use [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll).
This is to set up the `.jekyllconfig` file, which stores info necessary to use the Jekyll plugin.


## Help Screens

```
bash-it show aliases        # shows installed and available aliases
bash-it show completions    # shows installed and available completions
bash-it show plugins        # shows installed and available plugins
bash-it help aliases        # shows help for installed aliases
bash-it help completions    # shows help for installed completions
bash-it help plugins        # shows help for installed plugins
```

## Your Custom scripts, aliases, and functions

For custom scripts, and aliases, just create the following files (they'll be ignored by the git repo):

* `aliases/custom.aliases.bash`
* `lib/custom.bash`
* `plugins/custom.plugins.bash`

Anything in the custom directory will be ignored, with the exception of `custom/example.bash`.

## Themes

There are a few bash it themes.  If you've created your own custom prompts, I'd love it if you shared with everyone else!  Just submit a Pull Request to me (revans).

You can see the theme screenshots  [here](https://github.com/revans/bash-it/wiki/Themes)

## Misc

### Bash Profile Aliases
Bash it creates a 'reload' alias that makes it convenient to reload
your bash profile when you make changes.

### Prompt Version Control Check
Bash it provides prompt themes the ability to check and display version control information for the current directory. The information is retrieved for each directory and can slow down the navigation of projects with a large number of files and folders. Turn version control checking off to prevent slow directory navigation within large projects. 

Bash it provides a flag (`SCM_CHECK`) within the `~/.bash_profile` file that turns off/on version control information checking and display within all themes. Version control checking is on by default unless explicitly turned off. 

Set `SCM_CHECK` to 'false' to **turn off** version control checks for all themes: 

* `export SCM_CHECK=false`

Set `SCM_CHECK` to 'true' (the default value) to **turn on** version control checks for all themes: 

* `export SCM_CHECK=true`

**NOTE:**
It is possible for themes to ignore the `SCM_CHECK` flag and query specific version control information directly. For example, themes that use functions like `git_prompt_vars` skip the `SCM_CHECK` flag to retrieve and display git prompt information. If you turned version control checking off and you still see version control information  within your prompt, then functions like `git_prompt_vars` are most likely the reason why. 

## Help out

I think everyone has their own custom scripts accumulated over time.  And so, following in the footsteps of oh-my-zsh, bash it is a framework for easily customizing your bash shell. Everyone's got a custom toolbox, so let's start making them even better, **as a community!**

Send me a pull request and I'll merge it as long as it looks good. If you change an existing command, please give an explanation why. That will help a lot when I merge your changes in.

Thanks, and happing bashing!
