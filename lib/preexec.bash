# preexec.bash -- Bash support for ZSH-like 'preexec' and 'precmd' functions.

# The 'preexec' function is executed before each interactive command is
# executed, with the interactive command as its argument.  The 'precmd'
# function is executed before each prompt is displayed.

# To use, in order:

#  1. source this file
#  2. define 'preexec' and/or 'precmd' functions (AFTER sourcing this file),
#  3. as near as possible to the end of your shell setup, run 'preexec_install'
#     to kick everything off.

# Note: this module requires 2 bash features which you must not otherwise be
# using: the "DEBUG" trap, and the "PROMPT_COMMAND" variable.  preexec_install
# will override these and if you override one or the other this _will_ break.

# This is known to support bash3, as well as *mostly* support bash2.05b.  It
# has been tested with the default shells on MacOS X 10.4 "Tiger", Ubuntu 5.10
# "Breezy Badger", Ubuntu 6.06 "Dapper Drake", and Ubuntu 6.10 "Edgy Eft".

# This variable describes whether we are currently in "interactive mode";
# i.e. whether this shell has just executed a prompt and is waiting for user
# input.  It documents whether the current command invoked by the trace hook is
# run interactively by the user; it's set immediately after the prompt hook,
# and unset as soon as the trace hook is run.
