# Sets up the `_command_exists` function so that it only responds `true` if called with
# the name of the function that was passed in as an argument to `setup_command_exists`.
# This is used to ensure that the test cases can test the various energy management tools
# without actually having them. When called like
#
# setup_command_exists "pmset"
#
# then calling `_command_exists "pmset"` will return `true`,
# while calling `_command_exists "ioreg"` (or other commands) will return `false`.

# It's cool that Bash allows to define functions within functions, works almost like
